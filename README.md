# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.
<br>

> Tweeter allow users to post tweets within a 140-character limit. New tweets appear on the top of the page. Using AJAX, the app updates tweet pages asynchronously without reloading the whole page.
Tweeter Project uses [this repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) from LHL as template. To further develop the app, I used HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX in the front-end; Node and Express in the back-end. 
>Additionally, Tweeter has a dynamic responsive design that is compatible with both desktop and tablet screens.

This is my third project at LHL after [Lotide](https://github.com/thaian161/lotide) and [TinyApp](https://github.com/thaian161/tinyApp).
